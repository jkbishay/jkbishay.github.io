One of the most common questions asked by students who are just beginning to learn how to code is "why does the formatting matter?" Just about all of these students discover the answer to that question themselves after coding for a year or so. Coding standards are truly a great thing. It is because of these standards that we strive to make our code legible, comprehensive, and universal. The code is nice and neat for others to easily read and understand how it works. So, we assume that all we need to do when it comes to formatting our code is make it neat and legible. So we type our code, we space it out properly, we use consistent indentations, and if it looks nice then we are done and everything is great. 

Then, we turn our your code and the professor deducts twenty points for bad formatting which leaves us perplexed. All we can do is ask why, and the professor simply cites that the specific language coding standards were not perfectly followed. Chances are many lesser experienced programmers are not aware that the proper way to write a function is to put a space between the function name and the parentheses like so: 
```
// the correct way to write a function
function myFunc () {
  return 0;
}

// the incorrect way to write a function
function yourFunc() {
  return -1;
}
```
