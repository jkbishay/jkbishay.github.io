In school, most teachers will tell you that there is no such thing as a dumb or bad question. The main purpose of this saying is to give us the confidence to ask questions so that we may learn. However, this does not always appear to be true. It really is not that hard to spot a bad question, but what may not be clear at first is the reason why it is bad. It is true that there is no such thing as a bad question, but there are many ways to poorly ask the question.
