*The Ugly Beauty of Javascript*

If economics ever taught us anything, it's that people always face trade offs. You want to make something better? Then you have to let something else worsen.  You have to give something up in order to get something else. To me, Javascript models this economic principle quite well - maybe not in a simple way. 

## The Wonders of Javascript

Sometimes the most innovative and progressive ideas are the result of a bold decision to challenge a fundamental that has existed since the beginning. Javascript does just that by seemingly doing away with variable typings, and instead it just allows variables to exist. Want to declare a variable? Then do it! You don't need to worry if it's going to be a float, an integer, or a string until you actually have to use it. Now this is where Javascript is beautiful, the values of variables can be set to anything later on in the code because varaibles are not constricted to a single type. This allows for the swift creation of functions that can return both integers and strings without requiring additional code to change the type of the return variable. You can even input a variety of variable types and have the function respond to specific types of variables as well.
