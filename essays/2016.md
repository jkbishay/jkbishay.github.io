<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/degree_difficulty.jpg">*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

I graduated high school as a straight-A student with a GPA of 4.16, advanced classes, and a $5,000 per year scholarship. I was going to go to college to become an engineer, graduate in four years, and land a job with a fairly high salary immediately afterwards. I was a motivated and hard working youg adult, and I knew exactly what I was going to do with my future. Unitl I didn't.

I ended up just going through the motions in my first three semesters of college. The only thing I had really accomplished was checking off the boxes next to my graduation requirements. Strangely, the one class that had captivated me was an introductory programming class taught in C. It wasn't even that exciting of a class, everything we did was texted based. But there was something about coding that intrigued me. There wasn't much thrill in sitting in front of a computer and typing arbitrary letters, numbers, and words for hours. No, it was the process of coding, the trial and error, the freedom to create, and the magical result of what you coded - what you created. 

This was something I was able to envision myself doing for a living. I was truly excited about learning and doing more with programming, so I made a bold switch to computer science without further hesitation. The possibilities were now endless. I could pursue artificial intelligence, web development, even cyber security. I was not yet sure where I would go within the field, but I was sure of one thing - I am a gamer at heart. 

## In the context of programming

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
