"Super Circle Joe" is a 2D arcade-style shooter with comedic elements where the player must attack and dodge numerous waves of enemies. The player must switch the color of their attacks to correspond to the enemies they face in order to defeat them efficiently. There is a boss battle at the end of the level that the player can reach after defeating a certain amount of enemies. I developed this game myself as a personal project in Java.
